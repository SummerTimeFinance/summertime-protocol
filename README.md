# SummerTime Finance

### Introduction

**SummerTime Finance** is a decentralized stablecoin issuing protocol leveraging over-collateralization of locked yield-bearing liquidity.

SummerTime allows you to keep your yield-bearing crypto capital and its keep the upsides and be able to access & spend some of its value. There’s no need to sell your crypto to have a wonderful summer when you can have both at the same time.

### The Problem: Capital Illiquidity

There are billions of dollars locked & concentrated in numerous DeFi protocols/platforms represented as yield-bearing tokens to the user from the likes of automated market makers (AMMs) LP tokens e.g PancakeSwap, or yield-farming optimizers e.g Yearn, Beefy, Autofarm & PancakeBunny.

Locked is not necessarily a bad thing here, but this removes these billions of dollars out of circulation in DeFi, reducing overall liquidity available across the DeFi ecosystem, with no way for the ecosystem to access some or all of this value.

### The Product

SummerTime protocol’s 1st product is the **SHELL stablecoin**.

SHELL is a decentralized, censorship-resistant, unbiased, over-collateralized backed stablecoin, soft pegged to the U.S Dollar. Every SHELL token minted is backed by at least 110% of locked yield-bearing collateral from the user.

AMM LP token holders e.g BTCB-BNB, ETH-BNB, USDT-USDC, and others, driven to keep the upside to their portfolio can borrow up to 90.9% of their collateral by minting SHELL. Upon paying back their SHELL debt they will regain access to their collateral, which they have to lock in their protocol-controlled provisioned vaults.
